This project was created for the [Landing Page assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/landing-page) as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum. I met all the assignment objectives and then expanded on it with my own concepts to make it more functional and user-friendly.
